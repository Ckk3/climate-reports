# Climate Reports
## Description

Climate Reports is a Python application designed to process climate data and generate PDF reports. The application provides functionality to create, manage, and send climate reports via email.

## Setup and Installation
### Using Docker Compose

To set up and run the application using Docker Compose:

1. Setup Configuration:
    - Duplicate env-sample.py and rename it to env.py.
    - Add SMTP configurations to env.py.

2. Build and Run Containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will start the application and expose the TCP server on port 5784.

3. Attach to the Container:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
    ```
    Replace <container_name> with the name of your running container. You can find it using docker ps.

4. Activate Conda Environment:
    Inside the container, activate the Conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```

5. Navigate to the Application Directory:
    ```bash
    cd /app
    ```

6. Run Commands:
    
    You can now execute any commands needed within the container.

### Manual Setup

    conda env create -f environment.yml -n <environment_name>
    ```

    Replace <environment_name> with the name you want to your enviroment.

2. Activate Conda Environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate <environment_name>
    ```

3. Setup Configuration:
    - Duplicate env-sample.py and rename it to env.py.
    - Add SMTP configurations to env.py.

4. Navigate to the Application Directory:
    ```bash
    cd climate_reports_generator
    ```


## Usage
### Start TCP Server
To start the TCP server:
```bash
python climate_reports_generator/main.py
```
### Run Tests and Create Sample Data (Optional)
To run tests and populate the database with sample data:

```bash
pytest climate_reports_generator/tests.py
```

### Generate PDF Reports
To generate a PDF report, place your data file in the `climate_reports_generator/raw_data/` directory. Then run the following command:

```bash
python climate_reports_generator/report_generator.py TELEFONE DATA BRUTO [--ENVIA_EMAIL]
